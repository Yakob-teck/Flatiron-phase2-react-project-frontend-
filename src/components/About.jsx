          I am thrilled to introduce myself. I'm Yakob Asebe, a dedicated
          student at FlatIron School, and I'm excited to share my latest project
          with you. This project is the culmination of my journey into the world
          of React development. At its core, it's a video streaming platform
          designed to provide a seamless and interactive experience. Here, users
          can easily upload their videos and take advantage of intuitive search
          feature, which allows them to filter videos by title. I've poured My
          passion for web development into creating this platform, and I hope
          you find it both enjoyable and useful. Thank you for visiting, and
          please explore the site to discover the exciting features I've crafted
          just for you!
